# Scrape Airport Names from Wikipedia
Python code to scrape airport names by year or by state from Wikipedia. Also contains the URL for each airport's Wikipedia page, town the airport is located in, and the FAA code. Additional code is being developed that scrapes the coordinates and activation date from SkyVector.com, when that information is available.
